# Pizza Sales Analysis
The purpose of this project is to use a pizza shop's data to find some important patterns and insights into how this restaurant operates and makes profit.

## Objective
After digging into the data, multiple questions were constructed to gain better insight into the restaurant's operations:

- How many pizzas are being sold?
- When is the busiest season for the pizza shop?
- Which types of pizzas makes the most money?
- What are the most popular sizes that customers order?

  ## Data Used
  I used four tables for this analysis:

  - Orders (which shows the customers who bought pizzas)
  - Order Details (which reveals what the customers ordered)
  - Pizzas (which displays the different sizes and prices for each pizza)
  - Pizza types (which categorizes and names each type of pizza)
 
  ## Methods
  I used SQL to first clean the data then used CTEs (Common Table Expressions), window functions, aggregations and JOIN statements to gather financial insights.

  ## Result
  In the competitive restaurant industry, data analytics is crucial for a restaurant to figure out what is most popular and what needs to be paid more attention to. By utlizing its data, a restaurant can improve staffing, menu design and food promotions to lead to happier customers and better efficiency.

  After analysis, there were a few key findings for the restaurant:

  - Large pizzas ended up being the most popular size with 12,736 orders and 18,956 orders
  - Double extra large and extra large sizes had minimal orders, becoming the least popular sizes
  - The busiest time periods were 12-1 PM as well as 5-6 PM
  - The slowest time periods were late at night and early morning from 11 PM - 9 AM
